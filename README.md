# foodie

A new Flutter and Firebase project.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
Did you know that the amount of food produced in the world is enough to feed 1.5 times the world population . Still about 811 million people do not have enough to eat .That makes up 8.9% of world population .According to recent studies after slow declination until 2015, there has been an increase in hunger rates around the world .The world is not on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal for hunger. Global hunger isn’t about a lack of food. Right now, the world produces enough food to nourish every man, woman and child on the planet.$1 Trillion Dollars’ Worth of Food Is Wasted Each Year. Food Waste Is One of the Largest Producers of Carbon. Rich Countries Waste as Much Food as Sub-Saharan Africa Produces. Cutting Global Food Waste Is a Top U.N. Goal. Of the estimated 125 to 160 billion pounds of food ends up in a trash bin rather than a hungry stomach, much of it is perfectly edible and nutritious.

<h2>What it does</h2>
Cibus is a Mobile app that helps to donate or share your food. Any one can list their left food on this app, by clicking the add+ button. This will be made available to public. People can view the list of food that is kept for donation and go for it.
